### Student Info

-   Name: Conor Race
-   Section: Section 6

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: _This game will primarily be viewed from a top-down POV._
-   Camera Movement: _The in-game camera will slowly shift sideways, giving the illusion the player is traveling long distances._
-   Player Health: _The player will have access to a health bar, which will decrement varied amounts based on enemy attacks.
                    The player will also have 'X' amount of lives to be aware of._
-   End Condition: _Levels will end in a variety of ways. My thoughts: some levels will end when reaching a specific point, some
                    will end by collecting 'X' amount of one item, and some will end with a boss of sorts._
-   Scoring: _The player will earn points in a variety ways: defeating enemies, collecting treasure/quest items, how much health
              remains at the end of level, and of course, level completion._

## You Additions

-   Planning
    -   Mixed Level Endings: _I would like to try to go for a level set with diverse endings. Some that end with bosses, some that require
        specific objects, and some that require reaching a particular point._
    -   Environment Influence: _Depending what leg of the Race you're on, the surrounding environment will offer an interesting side effect
        to the player, which will offer unique challenges for the player (i.e: snowy section = reduced movement speed)._
    -   Skill Swap (Post-Death): _Should a player die while in the middle of a level, I would like to create a system that will allow them
        to swap their fighting style should they choose to help them better acclimate to the level (all levels will still be possible will
        all skills, but some skills might be more effective in certain levels)._
-   Added: TBD
