# SHMUP Project: Race to Draconic Heights

[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet)

### Student Info

-   Name: Conor Race
-   Section: Section 6

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: _This game will primarily be viewed from a top-down POV._
-   Camera Movement: _The in-game camera will slowly shift sideways, giving the illusion the player is traveling long distances._
-   Player Health: _The player will have access to a health percentage, which will decrement varied amounts based on enemy attacks.
                    The player will also have 3 lives to be aware of._
-   End Condition: _Levels will end in a variety of ways. My thoughts: some levels will end when reaching a specific point, some
                    will end by collecting 'X' amount of one item, and some will end with a boss of sorts._
-   Scoring: _The player will earn points in a variety ways: defeating enemies, collecting treasure/quest items, how much health
              remains at the end of level, and of course, level completion._

### Game Description

~ Here in the magic rich land of Acadia, soar to new heights as you learn to fly your first dragon! As a young dragon rider, you are
welcomed to participate in the "Race to Draconic Heights"! Complete various challenges the Race has to offer, while also uncovering
a dark mystery in the midst of it all! But be careful, as you aren't the only one looking to win the Race! WIll you triumph to
victory as the next "Champion of Fire"? ~

### Controls

-   Movement
    -   Up: _W / Up Arrow_ 
    -   Down: _S / Down Arrow_
    -   Left: _A / Left Arrow_
    -   Right: _D / Right Arrow_
-   Fire: _Space Bar_

## You Additions

-   Planning
    -   Mixed Level Endings: _I would like to try to go for a level set with diverse endings. Some that end with bosses, some that require
        specific objects, and some that require reaching a particular point._
    -   Environment Influence: _Depending what leg of the Race you're on, the surrounding environment will offer an interesting side effect
        to the player, which will offer unique challenges for the player (i.e: snowy section = reduced movement speed)._
    -   Skill Swap (Post-Death): _Should a player die while in the middle of a level, I would like to create a system that will allow them
        to swap their fighting style should they choose to help them better acclimate to the level (all levels will still be possible will
        all skills, but some skills might be more effective in certain levels)._
-   Added
    -   _Added a scrolling environment to give the game a more immersive feel to it. The environment uses an "infinite" reel with one background asset._

## Known Issues

-   While the game does work as intended, there was a small error in the Unity error where apparently the player fireballs had trouble instancing(?)

### Requirements not completed

-   As far as I know, I believe I have achieved all requirements for this project.
